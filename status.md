Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have done everything that I said I would accomplish in the original project proposal (A 2 player yahtzee game that runs for 13 rounds and for each of their turns, they get 3 rolls. After their third roll, they are shown where their current roll can be scored and they can enter where they would like their score to go) I have also accomplished some of the things that I did not think I would get to, such as allowing the player to pick where they wanted their score to go (I was going to "force" where their score would go by just picking the highest score for the current roll, but I just decided it would be better for the user to be able to pick where their score would go). I have also finished with the updating the scorecard part of my project. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

This is a big hope, but I would like to have a computer vs player version of what I currently have, but if I do not get to it, I am perfectly fine with my current work. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I had made a separate function for each scoring possibility in the game of Yahtzee, and a couple of them were not working the way they needed to at first, but I was able to fix them so that they returned the right amount.
